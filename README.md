# Sprig Boot

Since the day I got my [sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com),
I've always wanted to wanted to load **every** game onto the little thing at once.
Unfortunately, with the stock firmware, that's not possible.
However, using some tricker, we can get close!

Sprig Boot gives you a pretty menu to boot multiple sprig games with!
How many?
Well, it can hold roughly 200kb of games.

Enjoy!
